# Closures and Curries

Closures and currying are both important concepts in JavaScript, especially for functional programming.
## Closure
A closure is a function that has access to its outer scope even after the outer function has returned. It "closes over" its outer scope, hence the name. Here's an example:
```javascript
function outerFunction(x) {
  return function innerFunction(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}
const add5 = outerFunction(5);
console.log(add5(3)); // 8
```
In the above example, `**innerFunction**` has access to `**x**` even after `**outerFunction**` has returned. This allows us to keep state across multiple invocations of the inner function.
We can use closures to store a function with a first parameter, you can see an example here:

## Curries
Currying, on the other hand, is a technique where we convert a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes one argument and returns another function. This allows us to partially apply arguments to a function, making it more composable and reusable. Here's an example:
```javascript
function curry(fn) {
  return function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= fn.length) {
      return fn.apply(null, args);
    } else {
      return function(...moreArgs) {
        return curried.apply(null, args.concat(moreArgs));
      }
    }
  }
}
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}
const curriedAdd = curry(add);
const add5 = curriedAdd(5);
console.log(add5(3)(2)); // 10
```
In the above example, we take the `**add**` function and curry it with the `**curry**` function. This allows us to partially apply the `**5**` argument to the `**add**` function, creating a new function `**add5**` that takes two arguments instead of three.
```javascript
const add = function (a, b) {
	return a + b
}
const curriedAdd = curry(add)
console.log(curriedAdd(1)(2))
```
The example above of simple carry, its looks like closures but not function inside function
## Ramda
Ramda it’s a funcitonal javascript functions based on curry functions

> [!info] Ramda Documentation  
> Accepts a converging function and a list of branching functions and returns a new function.
